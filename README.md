This aims to help you practice Javascript / ECMAScript.

It follows the structure of the [MDN Javascript Guide](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide) and for each chapter, gives a set of relevant exercises for you to complete.
Each chapter of the guide has its own folder.

Template files for you to complete are named `template`, and a possible solution is present in `example.js`.
